# PythonC8
Quick and dirty Chip-8 Emulator written in python and using pygame.

Requires python version 3.10 or higher due to the use of match (switch statements).

## Install guide:
I really wouldn't recommend running this, but if you want to, the only required package is pygame.
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

## Launch:
The location of the rom file can be set on line 18 of the run.py file.

With the rom file set, and the rom placed in the same directory as the run.py file, launch the emulator using the following commant.
```bash
python3 ./run.py
```
