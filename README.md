# PythonC8
Quick and dirty Chip-8 Emulator written in python and using pygame.

Currently also includes a numpy dependency but I would like to cut that out.

## Install guide:
Install the required packages using tthe following command:
```bash
pip3 install pygame, numpy -y
```

## Launch:
The location of the rom file can be set on line 18 of the run.py file.

With the rom file set, and the rom placed in the same directory as the run.py fil, launch the emulator using the following commant.
```bash
python3 ./run.py
```
